# Product Landing Page

The webpage I submitted to freeCodeCamp for "Product Landing Page".

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to <https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks>

I did some changes with the "user-stories" section, and ended up with <https://scorpius07.github.io/Product-Landing-Page/>

For any suggestions or comments, contact me on my Discord (Scorpius07#7945). Thank you!
